# Game Design Document: H-Town Combat 67

## 1. Vision & Core Concept
**H-Town Combat 67** is a high-speed, 2v2 PvPvE Vehicle Extraction Survivor. It combines the chaotic power-scaling of "Bullet Heaven" games with the high-stakes risk/reward of "Extraction" shooters.

- **Genre**: Roguelite / Survival / Extraction / Vehicle Combat.
- **Pillars**:
    - **Clarity First**: Fixed top-down 3D camera for instant readability.
    - **Team Synergy**: Designed for 2v2 coordinated tactics (Tank/DPS loops).
    - **Risk-Reward**: You only keep the best loot (**Tech**) if you extract alive.
    - **The Garage**: Deep meta-progression using salvaged scrap and blueprints.

## 2. Core Gameplay Loop (The Match)
A typical match lasts 5–8 minutes.

1. **The Drop**: Players spawn in the Arena with their chosen vehicle and starting weapon.
2. **Survive & Scale**:
    - **Waves**: Enemies spawn in escalating intensity.
    - **Loot**: Defeated enemies drop **Scrap** (common) and occasionally **Relic Tech** (rare).
    - **Level Up**: Collecting scrap grants XP. Leveling up offers a choice of 3 random run-upgrades (synergy-driven).
3. **The Boss & Extraction**:
    - At Wave 4, a Boss or Elite horde spawns.
    - Upon defeat, the **Extraction Zone** appears.
    - **Hold the Line**: Players must stay within the zone for 30 seconds while waves intensify.
4. **Conclusion**:
    - **Victory**: Successful extraction (Keep all Scrap + Tech).
    - **Defeat**: Wiped (Keep 50% Scrap, Lose 100% Tech).

## 3. Persistent Systems (The Meta)

### 3.1 The Garage (Hub)
The central home for the player between runs.
- **The Shop**: Spend **Scrap** to unlock new Vehicles, Weapons, and Bounties.
- **The Tech-Lab (Skill Trees)**: Spend **Tech** (extracted from runs) to unlock permanent nodes in the Character Skill Trees.

### 3.2 Currencies
- **Scrap (🔩)**: The "bread and butter" currency. High volume, low rarity.
- **Relic Tech (💠)**: High rarity. The primary driver for "Extraction" tension. Required for late-game skill tree nodes.
